ðŸ¤– LIP23 project: CROBOTS ðŸ¤–
Define the parser and the small-step semantics of small battle robots competing in the programming game CROBOTS.

In order to make the project work you'll need to:

define a lexer in lib/lexer.mll
define a parser in lib/parser.mly
implement the interfaces lib/memory.mli and lib/trace.mli
